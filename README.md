# KDSudoku
I was thrilled with the Magic Sudoku App by *Brad Dwyer* (https://medium.com/@braddwyer/behind-the-magic-how-we-built-the-arkit-sudoku-solver-e586e5b685b0) and the concepts behind the development. KDSudoku is a replica of this app, and I could learn a lot while developing it. Everyone is invited to improve KDSudoku.
